There will be 6 homework assignments. Assignments will mix programming and short answer questions. Lab assignments will be graded on completion and correctness, but all test cases will be public. Your two lowest labs will be dropped.

40% homeworks and labs (25% homework, 15% labs)
25% Midterm
35% Final
(The midterm will tentatively be in class on Th March 12th. The final exam will be Wed May 13th 11:30am - 2:30pm.)


### Slip Days
Each student gets an extension budget of 5 slip days. You can use the extension on homework assignments (not lab assignments) during the semester. Do not plan to use your slip-time; it is there for unforeseen circumstances. These are rounded up, so if you are 1 minute late then 1 slip day will be used.

After you have used your slip-time budget, any assignment handed in late will be marked off 20% per day late, rounded up to the nearest integer of number of days. No assignment will be accepted more than 5 days late.


### Collaboration Policy (don't cheat)

Data science is a collaborative activity.
While you may talk with others about the homework, we ask that you write your solutions individually.
If you do discuss the assignments with others please include their names at the top of your notebook.
Keep in mind that content from the homeworks and labs will likely be covered on both the midterm and final.
We will be following the [EECS
departmental policy on Academic
Honesty](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/students/academic-dishonesty), so
be sure you are familiar with it.

    "The active hypothethical substitution of $W=1$ for the new model in 3) leads to an increased probability of exercise, hence lowering the probability of heart disease. In this case, the conditioning on $W=1$ has the same affect. Both lead to a probability of about 1/6. \n",

    "What we see is that fixing a variable by substitution may or may not correspond to a conditional probability. This is a formal rendering of our earlier point that observation isnâ€™t action. A substitution corresponds to an action we perform. By substituting a value we break the natural course of action our model captures. This is the reason why the substitution operation is sometimes called the do-operator, written as $\\mathrm{do}(W:=1)$.\n",
